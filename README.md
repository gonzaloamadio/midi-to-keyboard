## Why?

Just because I wanted to pause and rewind YouTube piano videos easily and more comfortably.

## Requirements

- Node.js

## Install

    $ npm install

## Configure

Create a `bindings.json` file at the root of the project and set the bindings between the MIDI messages and the keys.

The bindings for the keyboard can be found [here](http://robotjs.io/docs/syntax#keys)

Binding example:

```json
{
  "144": {
    "60": "c"
  }
}
```

`144` is the MIDI message for pressing a key. `60` is the central C key. So, whenever that key is pressed, the keyboard output will be the letter `c`

## Run the project

    $ node .
